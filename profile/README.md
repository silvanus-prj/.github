# SILVANUS - EU Horizon 2020

The SILVANUS project brings together a large consortium of interdisciplinary
experts from four continents to combat the threat of forest fires and improve
forest resilience against climate change.

The key output of the project is the release of a climate resilient forest
management platform to prevent and suppress forest fire. SILVANUS relies on
environmental, technical and social sciences experts to support regional and
national authorities responsible for wildfire management in their respective
countries. SILVANUS scientists and research engineers will aid the civil
protection authorities to efficiently monitor forest resources, to evaluate
biodiversity, to generate more accurate fire risk indicators, and promote
safety regulations among the local population affected by wildfire through
awareness campaigns.
